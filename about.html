	<p style=""> 
		7 out of 10 adults in the United States need eye correction. When I founded EyeSpy, LLC, it was very clear that people are overpaying for glasses as they are perceived as a health necessity and businesses are taking advantage of that. For this reason, EyeSpy, LLC is developing a system in which products from chosen eyewear vendors will be aggregated into a single database and consumers can search and select eyewear based on product prices from the various eyewear vendors. As a result, eyewear vendors increase their online presence and purchases via affiliate marketing. In addition, EyeSpy, LLC will develop a system in which consumers give reviews about the product and online shopping services, which in turn helps e-commerce enterprises and manufacturers to get customer opinion to improve their services and merchandise.

		By compiling prices on eyewear into a single convenient spot, EyeSpy, LLC provides consumers with the cheapest prices available. Set out to disrupt the traditional eyewear industry, EyeSpy, LLC is an eyewear price comparison website displaying a variety of both high-quality designer and house brands with a wide-range of styles and lens types including: single vision lenses, multifocal lenses, Rx sunglasses, sports glasses, kids glasses, contact lenses, digital protection, anti-reflective coatings and more.
