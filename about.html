    7 out of 10 adults in the United States need eye correction. When I founded EyeRadar, LLC, it was very clear that people are overpaying for glasses as they are perceived as a health necessity and businesses are taking advantage of that. For this reason, EyeRadar, LLC is developing a system in which products from chosen eyewear vendors will be aggregated into a single database and consumers can search and select eyewear based on product prices from the various eyewear vendors. As a result, eyewear vendors increase their online presence and purchases via affiliate marketing. In addition, EyeRadar, LLC will develop a system in which consumers give reviews about the product and online shopping services, which in turn helps e-commerce enterprises and manufacturers to get customer opinion to improve their services and merchandise.</p>
    <p class="lead">
      By compiling prices on eyewear into a single convenient spot, EyeRadar, LLC provides consumers with the cheapest prices available. Set out to disrupt the traditional eyewear industry, EyeRadar, LLC is an eyewear price comparison website displaying a variety of both high-quality designer and house brands with a wide-range of styles and lens types including: single vision lenses, multifocal lenses, Rx sunglasses, sports glasses, kids glasses, contact lenses, digital protection, anti-reflective coatings and more.

    I am from Recife, Brazil, and currently a Junior at the University of Texas at Dallas.
    I have many passions such as languages, classical dancing (Ballet), and programming. I enjoy teaching CS to students at my job at 'The Tutoring Club of Allen' and learning about it in school. In general, I am very excited to begin my career in software development.</p>
        <p>
        I got accepted into an internship at Dassault Systemès’ No Magic R&D, from May to August 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I wasn't able to attend.
Always looking for opportunities in the software development industry.</p>
